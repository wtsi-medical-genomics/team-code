    "Swampy (see Chapter 4) provides a module named `World`, which defines a user-defined type also called `World`. You can import it like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "from swampy.World import World\n",
    "```\n",
    "Or, depending on how you installed Swampy, like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "from World import World\n",
    "```\n",
    "The following code creates a `World` object and calls the `mainloop` method, which waits for the user.\n",
    "```\n",
    "world = World()\n",
    "world.mainloop()\n",
    "```\n",
    "A window should appear with a title bar and an empty square. We will use this window to draw Points, Rectangles and other shapes. Add the following lines before calling `mainloop` and run the program again.\n",
    "```\n",
    "canvas = world.ca(width=500, height=500, background='white')\n",
    "bbox = [[-150,-100], [150, 100]]\n",
    "canvas.rectangle(bbox, outline='black', width=2, fill='green4')\n",
    "```\n",
    "You should see a green rectangle with a black outline. The first line creates a Canvas, which appears in the window as a white square. The Canvas object provides methods like rectangle for drawing various shapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "`bbox` is a list of lists that represents the “bounding box” of the rectangle. The first pair of coordinates is the lower-left corner of the rectangle; the second pair is the upper-right corner.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can draw a circle like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "canvas.circle([-25,0], 70, outline=None, fill='red')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first parameter is the coordinate pair for the center of the circle; the second parameter is the radius.\n",
    "If you add this line to the program, the result should resemble the national flag of Bangladesh (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallery_of_sovereign-state_flags).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a function called draw_rectangle that takes a Canvas and a Rectangle as arguments and draws a representation of the Rectangle on the Canvas.\n",
    "2. Add an attribute named color to your Rectangle objects and modify draw_rectangle so that it uses the color attribute as the fill color.\n",
    "3. Write a function called draw_point that takes a Canvas and a Point as arguments and draws a representation of the Point on the Canvas.\n",
    "4. Define a new class called Circle with appropriate attributes and instantiate a few Circle objects. Write a function called draw_circle that draws circles on the canvas.\n",
    "5. Write a program that draws the national flag of the Czech Republic. Hint: you can draw a polygon like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "points = [[-150,-100], [150, 100], [150, -100]]\n",
    "canvas.polygon(points, fill='blue')\n",
    "```\n",
    "I have written a small program that lists the available colors; you can download it from http://thinkpython.com/code/color_list.py."
