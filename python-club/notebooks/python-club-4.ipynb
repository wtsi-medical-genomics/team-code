      "In our first meeting I mentioned how /software/Python-2.7.8/bin/python was reporting to be Python-2.7.3. After discussing with Emyr, this odd behaviour occurs because though I have explicitly called python-2.7.8's binary, it's library has not been loaded. To do this, we can prepend the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environmental variable:\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",

      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "If you are going to stick to one version of python from /software/ on the farm, I recommend putting the PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH exports in your .bashrc file. Then you don't have to worry about it. Another option is to place these lines at the top of your job script or a wrapper bash script.\n",

      "\n",
      "* As software is being updated all the time on the farm it is possible to be happily using version 1 of some python library one day then the next using version 1.1 without even knowing it. It is unlikely, though not impossible, to affect your work.\n",
      "* There may be conflicts with different package versions. For example, pandas requires numpy 1.7.0+ and the python at /usr/bin/ has numpy 1.6.1 so I would have to ask ISG to update their version before I can install pandas (with pip install --user pandas). To get around this I can create a virtual environment then install a new version of numpy to finally get pandas.\n",
      "* This is very handy in terms of reproducible science and pipelines as you can \"freeze\" your current package setup:\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",

      "\n",
      "#####To setup virtualenv:\n",

      "1. If you want to use a version of python in /software/ enter the following lines at the terminal or make sure they have been placed in your .bashrc \n",
